# IEEE CS CC 
This the project which contains level 0 level 1 and level 2 solutions and implementations.

#Level 0: It is all about simple doubly linked list implementation with insert at begining, insert at end and both forward and backward traversal. The code is present with the name of doubly_link_list_ieee_cs.c and the implementation is with doubly_link_list_implementation.png.

#Level 1: It is all about simple stack implementation with push, pop, top, getMin and getMax function in O(1) time and O(n) space. The code is present with the name of stack_ieee_cs.c and the implementation is with stack_implementation.png.

#Level 0: It is all about set Interval implementation with adding the interval (either straightforward or with merging with other intervals). The code is present with the name of set_interval_ieee_cs.c and the implementation is with set_interval_ieee_cs_implementation.png.
